A minimalistic expense tracker and analyzer that turns your spending into clear monthly and month-to-month insights, so you can finally answer:

## Demo

**Live website:** https://where-did-my-money-go.vercel.app/

## Problem

I have always struggled by the end of every month because I don’t know _where my money went_. Existing expense-tracking apps and platforms are either too complex or not free.

## Solution

I built a minimalistic expense tracker and analyzer that allows users to:

- Track expenses in a clean, table-based format
- Categorize transactions
- Generate natural-language explanations of spending behavior
- Quickly skim through monthly expense summaries
- Support multiple currencies

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **React + Vite**  
  Chose Vite over Next.js for its simplicity, faster development experience, and because the app does not require SSR or advanced routing features.

- **React Hook Form + Zod**  
  Chosen over Formik due to better type safety, less boilerplate, reusable schemas for future validation, and improved performance.

- **TanStack Router (file-based)**  
  Chosen over React Router to take advantage of built-in file-based routing.

- **Tailwind CSS**  
  Chosen over vanilla CSS to ensure design consistency and rapid development.

- **Shadcn UI**  
  Used to speed up UI development while maintaining consistency and focusing on core features.

### Testing

- **Vitest (Unit)**  
  Chosen because it integrates seamlessly with Vite.

- **Vitest + React Testing Library (Integration)**  
  Used for integration testing due to excellent compatibility with React and Vite.

- **Playwright (E2E)**  
  Chosen for end-to-end testing because of its simplicity and reliability.

### Backend

No backend is currently implemented due to the simplicity of the app and the lack of complex business logic.

## Architecture Overview (High Level)

- The frontend handles the UI and user-triggered actions.
- Triggered actions are handled by the domain layer.
- The domain layer performs any necessary business logic.
- The data layer manages data persistence when needed (e.g., local storage).
- Results are passed back to the frontend for display.
- The testing layer covers unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- A CI/CD pipeline runs tests, performs security checks using `npm audit`, builds the app, and automatically deploys to Vercel.

## Getting Started (Dev Setup)
